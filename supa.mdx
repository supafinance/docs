Supa is a smart contract wallet that facilitates the automation of on-chain actions for any protocol. Users can effortlessly build and execute strategies on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) protocol without coding.

**Core Features**

1. [Supa Wallet](/features/supa-wallet): A smart contract wallet that is flexible enough to abstract away the limitations of externally-owned accounts (EOAs).
2. [Macros](/features/macros): The ability to replay transactions with modified calldata, enabling generalization.
3. [No-Code Automation Builder](/features/automations): A user-friendly tool enabling users to add both on-chain and off-chain conditions to trigger contract interactions without the need for coding.

Users can also choose to share their automations in the Marketplace, a collection of public automations accessible to anyone.

We built Supa to help web3 users do what they want in less time with less work. Our goal is to usher in a new era of user interactions for web3, one that simplifies complexity and provides users a glimpse of the future.
