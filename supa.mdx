<!-- description: "Make digital money great again!"

We built Supa to help users get what they want with less work.
To enable this we built 3 core features into our product.

1. A smart contract wallet that is flexiable enought to abstract away what EOA's are limited to.
2. The ability to replay transactions with modified calldata, enabling generlization.
3. A no-code automation builder allowing users to add on-chain and off-chain conditions to trigger contract interactions.

With these core features we created Supa, A smart contract wallet that allows you to automate on-chain actions for any protocol. No coding needed to build and run strategies on any EVM protocol.

Users can chose to share automations for others to run enabling a marketplace of automations that anyone can use.

Our goal is to open a new era of user interactions for web3, one that abstracts away completxity and shows users what the future will look like.
