title: Why Supa
<!-- description: "Make digital money great again!"

We built Supa to help users get what they want with less work.
To enable this we built 3 core features into our product:

1. A smart contract wallet that is flexible enough to abstract away what the limitations of EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts).
2. The ability to replay transactions with modified calldata, enabling generalization.
3. A no-code automation builder, allowing users to add both on-chain and off-chain conditions to trigger contract interactions.

With these core features, we created Supa: a smart contract wallet that allows you to automate on-chain actions for any protocol. No coding needed to build and run strategies on any EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) protocol.

Users can choose to share their automations, enabling a marketplace of automations that anyone can use.

Our goal is to open a new era of user interactions for web3, one that abstracts away complexity and showcases what the future will look like.
