## Acquiring Power Credits

- **Access**: Click on the ⚡️ icon on the navbar.

## Usage of Power Credits

### Starting Automations

- **Initial Deposit**: Automations require a deposit of 5 PC to begin.
- **Refund Policy**: Upon stopping an automation, the 5 PC deposit is immediately refunded.
- **Consumption Rate**: Automations gradually consume PC over time.

### Paying Gas with PC

- **Default Setting**: By default, automations use PC to cover transaction costs.
- **Alternative Option**: Users preferring to use ETH or other native tokens must ensure these are available in their Supa Wallet.

## Running Out of Power Credits

### Scenario

- If a user's Power Credit balance falls below a critical threshold while automations are running, other users are given the opportunity to stop these automations.
- **Incentive**: Users who send a transaction to stop an automation under these circumstances are rewarded with a fee.

### Best Practices

- Users are advised to proactively manage their automations, either by stopping them in time or ensuring an adequate supply of Power Credits.

Utilizing Power Credits effectively is crucial for the smooth operation of automations in Supa. Users should regularly monitor their PC balance and manage their automations accordingly to avoid disruptions.
