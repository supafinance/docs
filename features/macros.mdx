## Overview

Macros are an integral feature of our platform, designed to store and reuse batch transactions. The primary function of macros is to construct and streamline actions in automations, making the process more efficient and user-friendly.

## Creating Macros

Macros can be created through two distinct methods, depending on the capabilities of the decentralized application (dApp) you are interacting with:

### Simulation Mode

- **Usage**: This mode is applicable when a dApp supports transaction simulations.
- **Process**:
  - Users can simulate transactions without needing to execute them.
  - During the simulation, users can observe the UI changes of the dApp and continue adding new transactions to the queue.
  - These simulated transactions can then be saved as a macro.

### Manual Mode

- **Usage**: This mode is utilized when a dApp does not support transaction simulations.
- **Process**:
  - Users are required to execute each transaction they want to record for a macro, step by step.
  - Executed transactions will appear in the transaction history queue but will not be re-executed.
  - To save these transactions as a macro, click on "Save Macro".
  - The executed and pending transactions will then be visible in the macro list.

Macros are designed to be flexible and user-friendly, catering to various user requirements and skill levels. Whether you're manually executing transactions or utilizing simulations, macros provide an efficient way to automate and replicate complex transaction sequences.
