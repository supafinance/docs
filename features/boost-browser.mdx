### Overview

The Boost Browser is a dynamic feature within our platform, designed to facilitate user interaction with the wider crypto ecosystem and streamline the creation of new automations. It's an integral tool for users looking to efficiently build macros and automate their crypto activities.

### Key Functions

**Interacting with Protocols**

To start, simply enter the URL of the crypto protocol you wish to interact with. Note: Some (dApps) may block iframes. If this occurs, alternative interaction methods must be used, or contact the protocol developers and request ti enable iframe support for supa.com.

**Transaction Simulation**

For protocols utilizing web3-react or the latest version of wagmi, the transaction simulation feature is available. This powerful tool allows users to simulate a series of transactions to achieve a desired end state. It enables the planning and testing of transaction sequences using the protocol's UI, without executing any real transactions until the user executes the batch call.

**Batch Transactions**

This functionality allows users to execute multiple transactions in one consolidated action, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.

**Session History**

Transactions executed in Boost mode appear grayed out in the transaction history stack but remain visible. These transactions will not be re-executed but are kept in view to assist users in creating macros based on past transactions. Unexecuted transactions are highlighted in blue. Upon refreshing the page, historical and pending transactions will disappear.
