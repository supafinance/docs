# Automations in Supa

## Introduction

`Automations` are a pivotal feature in Supa, designed to add a layer of versatility and efficiency to contract actions. By utilizing Gelato, automations transform contract actions into reusable deployment containers, enriched with user-defined conditions.

## Creation of Automations

- **Access**: Visit the automation section at [www.supa.finance/automations](www.supa.finance/automations) and click on 'Create'.
- **Process**: Start by selecting a macro, then add conditional options to tailor it to your needs.

## Types of Conditions

- **Flexibility**: Choose from on-chain or off-chain triggers to run your macros.

## Dynamic Inputs

- Dynamic inputs allow the modification of macro code values, creating more adaptable automations.
- **Types**:
  - **Native Token Balance**: Fetches the balance of native tokens like ETH, AETH, MATIC.
  - **Token Balance**: Retrieves the balance of ERC20 tokens in the deploying Supa Wallet.
  - **Current Time**: Provides the current time in Unix timestamp format.
  - **TokenID**: Useful for referencing NFTs generated during automation.
  - **Outputs from Other Contracts**: Utilize outputs from previous contract calls as inputs.
  - **Uniswap v3 Inputs**: Specific helpers for Uniswap v3, including swap slippage, liquidity amounts, and tick positions.

## Conditions

- **Types**:
  - **Timestamp**: Unix timestamp format for scheduling.
  - **Action Type**: Includes options like blocker, last, loop, and once, defining how and when conditions execute.
  - **If Types**: Logical operators like and, or, and nested for complex condition structures.
  - **Time Interval**: Schedule execution on a recurring basis (monthly, weekly, daily, hourly, etc.).

## Custom Conditions

- **On-chain**: Fetch a contract's ABI to call specific functions and set them as conditions.
- **Off-chain**: Call any public API returning a JSON object, with JSONata query support for logic application.
- **Dual-sided**: Compare two custom conditions, like prices from different sources.

## Tracked Price

- Enables price tracking in swap macros, allowing conditions based on price changes.

## Deployment

- Click 'Deploy', choose the Supa Wallet for deployment, and execute the transaction.
- Requires a minimum of 5 Power Credits to run an automation.

## Forkable Automations

- Users can copy and modify forkable automations, claiming ownership upon saving.

## Public and Private Automations

- **Public Automations**: Added to the marketplace for community use and sharing.
- **Private Automations**: Visible only to the creator, ensuring privacy.

## Cost

- Automations consume Power Credits at a rate of 0.0005 PC/min.
- 1 Power Credit equals approximately 2000 runs.

Utilize these features in Supa to create sophisticated, customizable automations that enhance your interaction with the web3 space.
