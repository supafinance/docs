### Create Wallet

- First go to www.supa.finance. Make sure you are connected to a supported chain.
- Go to the dashboard page and click on Create Wallet, confirm the transaction.

Now that you have a Supa wallet you can get started interacting with other protocols to build an automation or use the marketplace to deploy an automation. To run an automation youâ€™ll need to have Power Credits in your EOA or Supa wallet.
