### Create Wallet

- Go to www.supa.finance. Make sure you are connected to a supported chain.
{/* Should we elaborate on the supported chains here? */}
- Go to the "Dashboard" page.
- Click on the "Create Wallet" button.
- Confirm the transaction.

Now that you have a [Supa Wallet](/features/supa-wallet), you can start interacting with other protocols to build an automation or use the marketplace to deploy an automation.

To run an automation you'll need to purchase [Power Credits](/features/power-credits) in your externally-owned account (EOA) or Supa Wallet.
